# verybasicenum
Work in progress OSCP focused enumeration scripts. Winpeas/Linpeas and the like already exist, and the goal is not to re-invent the wheel, but rather to collect more basic information and practice automating about what information I am likely to seek out first manually when popping a shell on a machine. I doubt very much that I will include anything that isn't also included in more popular and involved enumeration scripts.

# verybasicenum
Very basic, work-in-progress, OSCP-focused enumeration scripts. The vbenum scripts are to get basic information about where to direct manual attention, especially while running winpeas/linpeas if possible, and the vbnmap script shows the output of a basic scan while running more detailed scans on all TCP and UDP ports so you can get started while it's still running. Perfect for adding additional commands for an autorecon-lite.
